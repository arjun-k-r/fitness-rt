  <h2>Why is mind balance important?</h2>
  <p>As Buddha said,
    <strong>"The mind is everything. What you think, you become"</strong>. Your thoughts and your perception of the world directly
    affect your body to the cellular level. In his book,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Belief-10th-Anniversary-Consciousness-ebook/dp/B011AE5OY6/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me="
      target="_blank">"The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles"</a> Bruce Lipton reveals how our cells
    and our genes change according the the perception of the environment. When we live in fear (stress), the cells don't
    grow and heal. It when the environment is positive, healthy, and full of love that growth, development, and healing occurs.</p>
  <p>Many research studies also reveal the power of our mind to heal or kill us through the placebo and nocebo effect.</p>
  <p>The science and phylosophy of the mind and consciousness is a topic beyond the scope of this application and it is still
    a mistery. But something is certein:
    <strong>the mind is the master control of our body and life</strong>.</p>
  <p>Beyond the body, your thoughts and beliefs have a direct
    <strong>impact on your reality and the Universe. You are what you think and you attract what you are</strong>.</p>
  <h2>What is stress and why is it so bad?</h2>
  <p>Stress is nothing more than
    <strong>a response, a feedback mechanism</strong>. There are multpiple kinds of stress:
    <strong>emotional, mental, and physical</strong>. Regardless of the kind, the body's response is the same:
    <strong>the "fight or flight" response</strong>. This response is our inner defense mechanism that helps us defend ourselves
    when we are in danger (we either fight, either run).</p>
  <p>This response is useful when we are in jungle, in the woods, in a battle, or whenver our life is threatened from time to
    time. The big problem is
    <strong>nowadays the "fight or flight" defense mechanism is uselessly activated too often</strong>. Our stress is no longer real,
    but
    <strong>it is all in our mind</strong>. It is only a
    <strong>negative perception</strong>.</p>
  <p>Basically, the stress response is regulated by the
    <strong>HPA (Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal) Axis</strong>. The
    <strong>hypothalamus is the master control</strong>. It is the link between our mind and body, the link between the nervous system
    and endocrine system. The hypothalamus commads the pituitary gland, which further commands the adrenal glands to secrete
    cortisol, along with epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine.</p>
  <p>Suprastimulation of the adrenal glands, as a result of stress, leads to adrenal fatigue. Prolonged chronic stress leads
    to every/any possible disease.</p>
  <p>During the "fight or flight" feedback mechanism, the
    <strong>blood flow and the functions of the vital organs are inhibited</strong> and the focus goes to the muscles, especially
    the arms and legs. This is because, when you are in danger, you need to run or fight as fast and strong as you can. You
    don't need digestion, you don't need conscious thinking, you don't need the immune system. You need a large amount of
    glucose in your blood and a rapid blood flow (heart rate) to send the energy and nutrients to the working muscles.</p>
  <p>The big problem is, you are not in danger. You are at the desk, in the office, in your car, at home. The stress is a false
    alarm, but the body doesn't know that. As a result, you end up, constantly, day by day, with
    <strong>inhibited vital organ functions, high blood glucose, high insulin levels to regulate the unused glucose, inhibited brain
      activity, and overstimulation of the heart and blood vessels</strong>.</p>
