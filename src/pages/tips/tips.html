    <h2>General tips</h2>
    <p>The Vatas find it very difficult to maintain regular habits, that is, to eat and sleep at regular times. But this is the most
      important thing for them to do. When Vata is out of balance this may feel almost impossible, but an effort to establish
      a regular routine is very important for all people with a Vata body type. Rest sufficiently, and choose foods, behaviors,
      personal relationships, and environmental circumstances which can be instrumental in balancing vata characteristics.
      It is also important to regulate mental and physical impulses and to modify mental attitudes, emotional states, and behaviors
      in supportive ways. Sweet, sour, and salty tastes decrease vata influences, so include these tastes if vata influences
      need to be diminished. Milk, wheat, rice, and some fruits and berries can provide sweet and sour tastes. Regular exercise
      should be relaxed and moderate. Hatha yoga practice in a meditative mood is good, as are t'ai chi, walking, and swimming.
      Avoid strenuous, competitive, frantic activities. When possible, associate with people who are calmly purposeful. Meditate
      every day for deep relaxation.</p>
