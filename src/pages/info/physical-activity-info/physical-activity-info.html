  <h1>Why is physical activity (exercise) important?</h1>
  <p>Physical activity and exercise are oftenly used interchangebly, but there is a small difference. According to ACSM, physical
    activity is the everything related to the movement of the body that takes effort and requires energy above that required
    at rest, whereas exercise is a specific, planned type of physical activity that is done in a structured manner to promote
    physical fitness. Thus,
    <strong>exercise is a subcategory of physical activity</strong>
  </p>
  <p>There is a big misconception that physical activity is only for weight loss, hence,
    <strong>people move only when they are trying to lose weight</strong>. Actually, physical activity is everything, but weight
    loss. The most important benefit of physical activity is
    <strong>increased and improved circulation</strong>. This automatically involves
    <strong>increased oxygenation, increased energy, lymph movement, increased nutrient utilisation, and increased toxin elimination</strong>
    through carbon dioxide and water.</p>
  <p>Exercise increases the
    <strong>development of lean muscle mass, bone density, and fat burn</strong>.</p>
  <p>Exercise has also been shown to decrease telomere shortening or even increase them. In her book,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Telomere-Effect-Revolutionary-Approach-Healthier/dp/1455587982/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517829320&sr=1-1"
      target="_blank">"The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer"</a> Nobel Prize-winning molecular
    biologist Elizabeth Blackburn reveals how telomeres are strictly correlated to longevity and health and exercise has
    a positive effect on telomeres.</p>
  <p>Other benefits of physical activity and exercise are side effects of the primary benefits mentioned above:
    <strong>improved cognitition, improved sleep, increased confidence and self-esteem, mood improvement, increased metabolism, etc.</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>Tips for becoming more active</h2>
  <p>There are 1,440 minutes in every day. Spend
    <strong>just 30 of those minutes in physical activity</strong>, and youâ€™ll be taking an important step toward improving your
    health. If you have been inactive for a while, use a sensible approach by
    <strong>starting out slowly</strong>. Gradually build up the time you spend doing the activity by adding a few minutes every
    few days until you reach 30 minutes a day. As this 30-minute minimum becomes easier,
    <strong>gradually increase either the length of time you spend in activity or the intensity</strong> of the activities you choose,
    or both.</p>
