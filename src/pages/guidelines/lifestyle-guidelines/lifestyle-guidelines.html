  <div *ngSwitchCase="'Vata'">
    <p>The Vatas find it
      <strong>very difficult to maintain regular habits</strong>, that is, to eat and sleep at regular times. But this is the most
      important thing for them to do. When Vata is out of balance this may feel almost impossible, but an effort to
      <strong>establish a regular routine is very important</strong> for all people with a Vata body type.
    </p>
    <p>Rest sufficiently, and choose foods, behaviors, personal relationships, and environmental circumstances which can be
      instrumental in balancing vata characteristics. It is also important to regulate mental and physical impulses and to
      modify mental attitudes, emotional states, and behaviors in supportive ways.</p>
    <p>Sweet, sour, and salty tastes decrease vata influences, so include these tastes if vata influences need to be diminished.
      Milk, wheat, rice, and some fruits and berries can provide sweet and sour tastes.
    </p>
    <p>Regular exercise should be relaxed and moderate. Hatha yoga practice in a meditative mood is good, as are t'ai chi, walking,
      and swimming. Avoid strenuous, competitive, frantic activities.</p>
    <p>When possible, associate with people who are calmly purposeful.</p>
    <p>Meditate every day for deep relaxation.</p>

  <div *ngSwitchCase="'Pitta'">
    <p>Pitta constitutions will be
      <strong>upset by alcohol and cigarettes, as well as by overwork, overexertion, and overheating</strong>. When out of balance,
      they are susceptible to feeling such negative emotions as
      <strong>hostility, hatred, intolerance, and jealousy</strong>. Therefore it is very important for Pittas to
      <strong>keep cool (literally and figuratively) and to lead a pure and moderate lifestyle
      </strong>. Choose foods, attitudes, behaviors, personal relationships, and environmental circumstances which can be
      instrumental in balancing pitta characteristics.</p>
    <p>Because sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes decrease pitta influences, include these in your food plan if pitta characteristics
      are too pronounced. Complex carbohydrates, milk, and some fruits are sweet; some green, leafy vegetables are bitter;
      beans and some green vegetables are astringent.
    </p>
    <p>Do things that cool the mind, emotions, and body. Avoid conflicts. Cultivate the virtues of honesty, morality, kindness,
      generosity, and self-control.</p>

  <div *ngSwitchCase="'Kapha'">
    <p>Kapha's are
      <strong>prone to lethargy, sluggishness, depression, and overweight, Kaphas need activity and stimulation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Daily exercise is more important for them than for any other type. Getting out of the house and actively seeking new
      experiences is also valuable. </p>
    <p>Be receptive to useful change, renounce impediments to progress, be intentional in implementing life-enhancing actions,
      and choose foods, mental attitudes, behaviors, exercise routines, and relationships and environmental circumstances
      which can be instrumental in balancing kapha characteristics. </p>
    <p>Pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes decrease kapha influences. Black pepper, ginger, cumin, chili, and some other
      spices provide the pungent taste; bitter is provided by some green leafy vegetables; and some green vegetables and
      beans provide the astringent taste. Note that the taste that decreases a dosha usually increases one or both of the
      other two. For general purposes, mildly increase the proportion of foods which are helpful while somewhat decreasing
      the proportions of others-having a sampling of all six tastes at your major meal.
    </p>
    <p>Meditation can be more intensive for kapha constitutions than for vata or pitta constitutions. Schedule time every day
      for prayer and meditation.</p>
