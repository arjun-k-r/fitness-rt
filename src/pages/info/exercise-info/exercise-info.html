  <h1>Why is exercise important?</h1>
  <p>There is a big misconception that exercise is only for weight loss, hence,
    <strong>people exercise only when they are trying to lose weight</strong>. Actually, exercise is everything, but weight loss.
    The most important benefit of exercise is
    <strong>increased and improved circulation</strong>. This automatically involves
    <strong>increased oxygenation, increased energy, lymph movement, increased nutrient utilisation, and increased toxin elimination</strong>
    through carbon dioxide and water.</p>
  <p>Another benefit of exercise is
    <strong>development of lean muscle mass, bone density, and fat burn</strong>.</p>
  <p>Exercise has been shown to decrease telomere shortening or even increase them. In her book,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Telomere-Effect-Revolutionary-Approach-Healthier/dp/1455587982/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1517829320&sr=1-1"
      target="_blank">"The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer"</a> Nobel Prize-winning molecular
    biologist Elizabeth Blackburn reveals how telomeres are strictly correlated to longevity and health and exercise has
    a positive effect on telomeres.</p>
  <p>Other benefits of exercise are side effects of the primary benefits mentioned above:
    <strong>improved cognitition, improved sleep, increased confidence and self-esteem, mood improvement, increased metabolism, etc.</strong>
