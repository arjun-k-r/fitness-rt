  <h2>What's my mind-body constitution?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>You are unique</strong> at the biochemical and energetic level. In Ayurveda, the 5000 year old indian science of life,
    each individual has a unique constitution, called Prakruti, established at the moment of conception. It reveals
    <strong>the unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics of eah individual</strong>.</p>
  <p>There are
    <strong>three main constitutional forces, called doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha</strong>. Although each peron has a dominant
    dosha, all three of them exist within us in varying proportions. It is
    <strong>the proportions of the three doshas that makes us unique</strong>.</p>
  <p>Although your constitution is permanent, your present state, called Vikruti, is dynamic; this happens whenever you are
    in a state of imbalance. It is also influenced by your environment, by the time of the year, by the time of the day,
    and by your daily lifestyle. Thus, you have to constantly
    <strong>adjust your lifestyle every day in order to remain in balance</strong> to your unique constitution (diet, activities,
    sleep, hobbies etc.).
  </p>
  <p>Each one of the three doshas has a corespondent in the
    <strong>science of body typing and metabolic typing: Vata is Ectomorph and Carbo Type, Pitta is Mesomorph and Mixed Type, and
      Kapha is Endomorph and Protein Type</strong>.</p>

  <h2>What's my basal metabolic rate?</h2>
  <p>Basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is the
    <strong>energy expended just to maintain the body’s basal, or resting, functions</strong>. These functions include respiration,
    circulation, maintaining body temperature, synthesis of new cells and tissues, secretion of hormones, and nervous system
    activity. The majority of our energy output each day (about 60% to 75%) is a result of our BMR. This means that 60% to
    75% of our energy output goes to fuel the basic activities of staying alive, aside from any physical activity.
  </p>
  <p>Your BMR is determined using the
    <strong>Revised Harris-Benedict Equation</strong>, based on your age, gender, height, and weight. This formula is quite limited,
    because your BMR is constantly
    <strong>influenced by your lifestyle: sleep, exercise, diet, and your inner state (thoughts and emotions).</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The primary determinant of our BMR is the amount of lean body mass we have. People with a
    <strong>higher lean body mass have a higher BMR</strong>, as lean body mass is more metabolically active than body fat.</p>
  <p>BMR decreases with age, approximately 3% to 5% per decade after age 30. This agerelated decrease results partly from hormonal
    changes, but much of this change is due to the loss of lean body mass resulting from physical inactivity. Thus, a large
    proportion of this decrease may be prevented with regular physical activity.</p>
  <h2>What's my body fat percentage?</h2>
  <p>You percentage of body fat determines the
    <strong>amount of addipose tissue</strong> and, by difference, your lean muscle mass your have.</p>
  <p>Some addipose tissue is required for optimal health, but too much of everything is bad. Excess body fat and poor lean muscle
    mass leads to health decline. The ideal body fat percentage is around
    <strong>13% for men and 24% for women</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>What are my resting, maximum, and training heart rates?</h2>
  <p>Your resting heart rate is your heart rate at rest, at moderate room temperature, and not being exposed to physical or
    emotional stimulation. Your training heart rate is the range of beats per minute your heart should have in order to get
    the most benefits out of your exercise. Basically, it indicates
    <strong>how intense you SHOULD exercise</strong>. Your maximum heart rate is the limit of beats per minute your heart must have
    during an intense exercise (VO2 max or maximum aerobic capacity). Basically, it indicates
    <strong>how intense you COULD exercise</strong>. The training heart rate and maximum heart rate are calculated using
    <strong>The Karvonen method and Nes, B.M, et al. formula</strong> respectively</p>
  <h2>What's my body shape?</h2>
  <p>Your body shape is based on the
    <strong>proportions between your chest, waist, and hips (women)</strong>. Your body shape is an indicator of your overall fitness,
    especially of your hormonal balance. The ideal shape is the
    <strong>"V shape" for men and the "Hourglass shape" for women</strong>. The body shape is
    <strong>influenced by your genes, lifestyle, and hormones</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Apple-shaped fat patterning</strong>, or upper-body obesity, is known to significantly increase a person’s risk for many
    chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. It is thought that the apple-shaped
    patterning causes problems with the metabolism of fat and carbohydrate, leading to unhealthful changes in blood cholesterol,
    insulin, glucose, and blood pressure.</p>
  <p>In contrast,
    <strong>pear-shaped fat patterning</strong>, or lower-body obesity, does not seem to significantly increase your risk for chronic
    diseases. Women tend to store fat in their lower body, and men in their abdominal region.</p>
  <h2>What are my measurements?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Age - your age in years;</li>
    <li>Height - your height without shoes;</li>
    <li>Weight - your body weight without clothing;</li>
    <li>Waist size – measure around your waist at your navel and also at the point midway between your navel and the bottom of
      your sternum, and take the average of these two measurements - that is your "Waist" measurement. Stand tall, but do
      not deliberately suck in your stomach or the estimation will be wrong;
    </li>
    <li>Iliac – measure around where your upper pelvic bones protrude the most (you can feel for them on either side of your
      waist/hips);
    </li>
    <li>Hips – measure around the hips at the maximum protrusion of the buttocks.</li>
  </ul>
