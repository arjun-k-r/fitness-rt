  <h2>What's my mind-body constitution?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>You are unique</strong> at the biochemical and energetic level. In Ayurveda, the 5000 year old indian science of life,
    each individual has a unique constitution, called Prakruti, established at the moment of conception. It reveals
    <strong>the unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics of eah individual</strong>.</p>
  <p>There are
    <strong>three main constitutional forces, called doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha</strong>. Although each peron has a dominant
    dosha, all three of them exist within us in varying proportions. It is
    <strong>the proportions of the three doshas that makes us unique</strong>.</p>
  <p>Although your constitution is permanent, your present state, called Vikruti, is dynamic; this happens whenever you are
    in a state of imbalance. It is also influenced by your environment, by the time of the year, by the time of the day,
    and by your daily lifestyle. Thus, you have to constantly
    <strong>adjust your lifestyle every day in order to remain in balance</strong> to your unique constitution (diet, activities,
    sleep, hobbies etc.).
  </p>
  <p>Each one of the three doshas has a corespondent in the
    <strong>science of body typing and metabolic typing: Vata is Ectomorph and Carbo Type, Pitta is Mesomorph and Mixed Type, and
      Kapha is Endomorph and Protein Type</strong>.</p>

  <h2>What's my basal metabolic rate?</h2>
  <p>Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy in kilocalories you burn during periods of inactivity. Your BMR
    is determined using the
    <strong>Revised Harris-Benedict Equation</strong>, based on your age, gender, height, and weight. This formula is quite limited,
    because your BMR is constantly
    <strong>influenced by your lifestyle: sleep, exercise, diet, and your inner state (thoughts and emotions).</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>What's my body fat percentage?</h2>
  <p>You percentage of body fat determines the
    <strong>amount of addipose tissue</strong> and, by difference, your lean muscle mass your have.</p>
  <p>Some addipose tissue is required for optimal health, but too much of everything is bad. Excess body fat and poor lean muscle
    mass leads to health decline. The ideal body fat percentage is around
    <strong>13% for men and 24% for women</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>What are my resting, maximum, and training heart rates?</h2>
  <p>Your resting heart rate is your heart rate at rest, at moderate room temperature, and not being exposed to physical or emotional stimulation. Your training heart rate is the range of beats per minute your heart should have in order to get the most benefits out
    of your exercise. Basically, it indicates <strong>how intense you SHOULD exercise</strong>. Your maximum heart rate is the limit of beats per minute your heart must have during an intense exercise
    (VO2 max or maximum aerobic capacity). Basically, it indicates <strong>how intense you COULD exercise</strong>. The training heart rate and maximum heart rate are calculated using
    <strong>The Karvonen method and Nes, B.M, et al. formula</strong> respectively</p>
  <h2>What's my body shape?</h2>
  <p>Your body shape is based on the
    <strong>proportions between your chest, waist, and hips (women)</strong>. Your body shape is an indicator of your overall fitness,
    especially of your hormonal balance. The ideal shape is the
    <strong>"V shape" for men and the "Hourglass shape" for women</strong>. The body shape is
    <strong>influenced by your genes, lifestyle, and hormones</strong>.</p>
