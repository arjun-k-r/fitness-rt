  <h2>Why is sleep important?</h2>
  <p>Sleep is more important than diet and eercise combined. Most of our
    <strong>tissue and cellular regeneration and growth</strong> occurs during sleep. Our
    <strong>body heals itself</strong>, basically, during sleep.</p>
  <p>Sleep also adjust our circadian rhythm which is our biological clock. The circadian rhythm dictates all the metabolic reactions
    the occur on the cellular level.</p>
  <p>Sleep is our
    <strong>absorbative state</strong> during which all information and nutrients are being accumulated. It is also our
    <strong>most anabolic state</strong>, which is the reason why children need so much sleep.</p>
  <p>Our mind is also recovering (resting) during sleep, because the brain switches to delta state (deep sleep).</p>
  <h2>Why is bed time important?</h2>
  <p>It is important to have a consistent bedtime so that the body knows how to
    <strong>adjust the circadian rhythm</strong> by stimulating the proper hormones at proper times. Also, it is important to
    <strong>catch the 10:00 pm 02:00</strong> window during which the body produces healing and anabolic hormones.</p>
  <p>Basically,
    <strong>the more syncronised you sleep, the higher the quality of your sleep and life.</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>How much should I sleep?</h2>
  <p>Your sleep runs on cycles of REM and non-REM. REM stands for Rapid Eyed Movement. Each cycle lasts for 90-110 minutes,
    varying from individual to individual. Basically, you need
    <strong>5 complete sleep cycles equal to 7-9 hours</strong>.
