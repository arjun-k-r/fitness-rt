          Sometimes we all get angry "for good reason.” But for some people, feelings of anger or irri- tability occur frequently or
          even daily, and are specifically influenced by what is - or isn't eaten. Skip this question if you do not experi-
          ence anger or irritability that is affected by food.

          Some people say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But this simply isn't true from a metabolic perspective.
          Acru- ally, every time you eat anything, what you eat is very important, because your ability to function depends
          on the kind of fuel you pro- vide your "engines of metabolism." What kind of breakfast gives you the greatest energy,
          sense of well-being, peak performance, and satisfies your hunger the longest?

          Appetites vary dramatically from person to person, from ravenous to normal to very little. Of course, your appetite can vary
          from day to day to some degree, but what is being asked about here is your overall tendency. A "normal" appetite
          is to feel hunger around regular mealtimes (morning, noon, and evening), but not to a noticeable extreme in either
          direction.

          Concentration or intense mental activity actually uses up a lot of energy and thus requires sufficient fuel. But it also
          requires the right kind of fuel-to enable individuals to maintain mental clarity and stay focused. The wrong kind
          of fuel can make your mind hyper, causing a flood of uncontrollable thoughts. Or you could feel spacey or sleepy,
          or experience thoughts that seem to dissipate as soon as they arise. What foods worsen your ability to concentrate?

          Eating before bed helps some people sleep better, while it clearly disrupts other people's sleep. For some, it depends on

          Different types of metabolizers have different feelings toward food. Some people are very focused on food. They think about
          it a lot. They imagine what they'll be eating long before mealtimes. They enjoy talking about food, particularly
          about their likes and dis- likes, or recounting stories of great meals or restaurants. These are the "live to eat"
          types. For others, food is almost the last thing on their minds, even to the point of forgetting to eat. They tend
          to view food more as one of life's unavoidable necessities, as compared to one of life's real pleasures. Having
          to eat is bad enough, but talking about food is an uninteresting waste of time. They're the "eat to live" types.
          What's your attitude toward food?

          Some metabolic types hardly notice when they haven't eaten. They often just happen to look at their watch and realize that
          it's long past their mealtime. But other metabolic types don't do well at all if they miss a meal. Their bodies
          let them know in no uncertain terms that it's time to eat. If they miss a meal, their performance drops dramatically.
          What happens to you when you go four hours or more without eating or skip a meal altogether?

          No one likes to gag, but everyone has a gag reflex. However, sensitivity to the gag reflex varies dramatically. Some people
          gag often and very, very easily-at the dentist's, while brushing teeth and tongue, even from eating. Others rarely,
          if ever, gag, and it takes a lot for them to gag when they do. How would you describe your gag reflex?

          in order to fall asleep again. With that in mind, do any of the following choices apply to you?

          This question concerns itching skin that is not due to bites or stings. Everyone's skin itches occasionally. But some people
          find that their skin itches on a regular daily basis, typically the scalp, arms, or calves. Because they're so
          used to it, they may not even be conscious of their frequent scratching.

          If you eat the wrong foods for lunch, you're likely to tank in the afternoon. Instead of being productive, you may find that
          you can barely keep your eyes open, or that you need coffee or candy to try to stay alert and focused. If you ate
          a large vegetarian salad for lunch, what effect would it have on your productivity through the afternoon?

          Many people have had the experience of their mouth becoming very dry when frightened or nervous, such as when they're about

          good food. However, for some people, these conditions are their natural tendency for no apparent reason. Please
