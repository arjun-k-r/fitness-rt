  <h1>Why is diet important?</h1>
  <p>There are <strong>thousands of chemical reactions going on in your body</strong> at every second. These processes are interconnected through
    pathways and are constantly rebuilding your body at the cellular level. The summation of all these processes determine
    your <strong>metabolism</strong>. You can imagine the metabolic pathways as assembly lines where the machinery and workers are enzymes,
    coenzymes, and cofactors and the products are substrates. These processes require fundamental materials and energy to
    be carried out. The body is able to synthesise some materials, but most materials, especially energy, need to be provided
    from diet. These materials are called nutrients.</p>
  <p>The required nutrients, which the body is unable to synthesize on its own, are called essential or insispensable.
    <strong>A healthy diet is, thus, a diet that provides all the essential nutrients, in the right proportions for each individual,
      and all the energy coming from the right proportions of fuels.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats</strong> are the sources of energy and are required in large quantities (grams), hence,
    they are called
    <strong>macronutrients</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Carbohydrates are the major source of energy</strong>. They are found in plants, especially in grains, legumes, fruits,
    and sugary foods.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Proteins are chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of our body</strong>. They are found mostly in spirulina,
    chlorella, meat, cheese, nuts, seeds, and legumes.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fats - lipids - are the primary energy storage</strong>, which serve as secondary source of energy during fasting and
    when carbohydrates are not present. Lipids also serve as building blocks for cell membranes, nutrient carriers, and steroids.
    They are mostly found in meat, dairy products, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils, and fats.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fiber is the non-digestable part of plants</strong> found especially in skins and the outer shells of seeds. It is required
    <strong>for our intestinal microbiota</strong>. It is mostly found in
    <strong>plant seeds (nuts, seeds, grains, legumes)</strong>. Be careful with plant seeds, because they contain
    <strong>high amount of toxic chemicals, called antinutrients, that cause inflammation and damage to the digestive tract and prevents
      the absorption of the essential nutrients</strong>. They lead to disease.
    <strong>Always soak, sprout, ferment, and/or cook plant seeds before consuming them</strong>. If you still notice digestive discomfort
    (bloating, cramps, flatulence, constipation, diarheea, eliminate them completely).</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Water is the second most important nutrient after oxygen. We are 70% water</strong> and is, thus, the most abundant substance
    in our body. It is required for all metabolic processes.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sugars are simple carbohydrates.</strong> Carbohydrates are chains and branches of sugar molecules. The longer and branched
    they are, the more complex they are, and the more digestion they require.</p>
  <p>The big problem with carbohydrates is they raise insulin levels.
    <strong>The more processed and more simple the carbohydrates are, the more insulin they raise</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>High insulin levels (high sugar) leads to insulin resistence, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, high blood cholesterol,
      liver disease, aging, cancer, and all diseases</strong>.</p>
  <p>Foods that raise insulin are
    <strong>food with high glycemic index and you should limit them</strong> as much as you can. They are
    <strong>refined grain products (breads, pastas, cookies, crackers, bagels, doughnuts, pizza, burgers, cereals, etc.) and sweets
      (candy, sodas, cakes, fruits, honey, sugar, etc.)</strong>. The impact on insulin is unqiue to each individual. Some
    indivudals respond better to high glycemic food and others respond worse. The best way to test is using a glucometer.</p>
  <p>
    <strong></strong>. They are a result of partial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats to make lengthen their shelf life. They
    are found in
    <strong>margarine, vegetable oils, and all products that contain them (potato chips, pizza, cookies, canned food, fast-food,
      chocolate, candies, doughnuts, pancakes, bagels, etc.)</strong>.</p>
  <p>The
    <strong> essential fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, and vitamins</strong> provide the building blocks necesarry for all metabolic
    pathways, cellular activities, and development. They are required in small quantities (mg, ug), hence, they are called
    <strong>micronutrients</strong>.</p>
  <p>The
    <strong>proportions and quantities of these nutrients are unique to each individual and are influenced by environemnt, genese,
      and lifestyle</strong>. At the beginning, you receive dietary recommended intakes (DRI), according to your gender and
    age. These recommendations should be taken only as a guideline and headstart, because of their standardization. Also,
    the proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats depend on your unique constitution and on your activity levels and
    types.

  <h2>Tips for a healhy diet</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>eat real and wholesome food, with minimum human intervention (processing), with least ingredients on the label (1-3),
      organically grown (non-GMO, no pestecicides, no herbicides), free-range, stress-free, grass-fed (cow, sheep, lamb,
      etc.)
    </li>
    <li>eat mostly fresh (in season) food from local farmers</li>
    <li>eat half raw and half cooked</li>
    <li>prepare the food by yourself correctly (no overcooking, no microwave, soaking, sproating, and fermenting)</li>
    <li>limit added sugars, salt, and fats</li>
    <li>eat slowly and chew very well (drink your food and chew your drink)</li>
    <li>focus on your food when eating and avoid stressful/agitated environments</li>
    <li>never eat when sad, happy/excited, nervous, angry</li>
    <li>eat only when hungry and stop before being full (80% full)</li>
    <li>avoid eating 2 hours before bed</li>
    <li>limit meat consumption and for every portion of meat eat the double in plants</li>
  </ul>
