  <h2>What's my cunstitution?</h2>
  <p>In Ayurveda, the 5000 year old indian science of life, each individual has a unique constitution, called Prakruti, established
    at the moment of conception. It reveals
    <strong>the unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics of eah individual</strong>.
    <p>There are three main constitutional forces, called doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. There are also other 4 subcategories
      that result as a combination of the three.</p>
    <p>Although your constitution is permanent, your present state, called Vikruti, is dynamic; this happens whenever you are
      in a state of imbalance. Thus, you have to constantly
      <strong>adjust your lifestyle every day in order to remain in balance</strong> to your unique constitution (diet, activities,
      etc.).

  <h2>What's my metabolic type?</h2>
  <p>Each of us has a
    <strong>unique metabolism based on our genes, environment, and lifestyle</strong>. As vehicles run on differnt kinds of fuel,
    <strong>your source of energy and nutrient requirements are unqiue</strong>.</p>
  <p>There are three metabolic types: Protein, Carbo, and Mixed.</p>
  <p><strong>Protein types</strong> are fast oxidizers or parasympathetic dominant (burn energy very fast and are more chill).</p>
  <p><strong>Carbo types</strong> are slow oxidizers and sympathetic dominant (burn energy slow and are more alert).</p>
  <p><strong>Mixed types</strong> are a combination of Protein cand Carbo type.</p>
  <p>Your metabolic type doesn't have to be constant. It may change throughout the year according to environmental changes and
    to your lifestyle. Rememmber to
    <strong>always listen to your body</strong> and repeat the test as many times as you feel like.</p>
  <h2>What's my basal metabolic rate?</h2>
  <p>Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy in kilocalories you burn during periods of inactivity. Your BMR
    is determined using the
    <strong>Revised Harris-Benedict Equation</strong>, based on your age, gender, height, and weight. This formula is quite limited,
    because your BMR is constantly
    <strong>influenced by your lifestyle: sleep, exercise, diet, and your inner state (thoughts and emotions).</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>What's my body fat percentage?</h2>
  <p>You percentage of body fat determines the
    <strong>amount of addipose tissue</strong> and, by difference, your lean muscle mass your have.</p>
  <p>Some addipose tissue is required for optimal health, but too much of everything is bad. Excess body fat and poor lean muscle
    mass leads to health decline. The ideal body fat percentage is around
    <strong>13% for men and 24% for women</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>What's my body shape?</h2>
  <p>Your body shape is based on the
    <strong>proportions between your chest, waist, and hips (women)</strong>. Your body shape is an indicator of your overall fitness,
    especially of your hormonal balance. The ideal shape is the
    <strong>"V shape" for men and the "Hourglass shape" for women</strong>. The body shape is
    <strong>influenced by your genes, lifestyle, and hormones</strong>.</p>
